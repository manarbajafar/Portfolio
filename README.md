# Manar Portfolio 
This XML file is a representation of my personal portfolio, showcasing my personal details, educational background, internships, skills, projects, publications, and volunteer work. The file is organized in a hierarchical structure, making it easy to manage and access various sections, such as education, professional experience, and skills. Iâ€™ve included relevant attributes such as degree titles, project durations, and roles to ensure that the data is both comprehensive and meaningful, Each section presenting a clear overview of my career path.
The XSD schema defines the format and rules for the XML, ensuring data consistency and proper validation. The XSLT file transforms the XML data into an HTML format, enabling the portfolio to be presented in a clean and accessible way, suitable for web display. This ensures that the information is not only machine-readable but also human-friendly when viewed in a browser.

This project was developed  As a requirement for Internet Technologies (Semantic Web) course at KAU.
